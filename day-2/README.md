## Exercises

### Math 1: Arithmetic, Functions 
- Use one variable to set the position and size for three ellipses
- Use multiplication to create a series of lines with increasing space between each.
  
### Control 1: Decisions
- Create a few relational expressions and print their evaluation to the console with println()
- Create a composition with a series of lines and ellipses. Use an if structure to select which lines of code to run and which to skip.
- Add an else to the code from exercise 2 to change which code is run

### Control 2: Repetition
- Draw a regular pattern with five lines. Rewrite the code using a for structure.
- Draw a dense pattern by embedding two for structures.
- Combine two relational expressions with a logical operator to control the form
of a pattern.

### Shape 2: Vertices
- Use beginShape() to draw a shape of your own design.
- Use different parameters for beginShape() to change the way a series of vertices
are drawn.
- Draw a complex curved shape of your own design using bezierVertex().
