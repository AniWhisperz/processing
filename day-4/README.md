## Exercises
### Data 4: Arrays
- Create an array to store the y-coordinates of a sequence of shapes. Draw each shape inside draw() and use the values from the array to set the y-coordinate of each.

### Input 4: Mouse II
- Change the properties of a shape based on the cursorâ€™s distance to its center.
- Using the techniques introduced in this unit, create three shapes that each follow
the mouse in a different way.

### Transform 2: Rotate, Scale
- Use rotate() to change the orientation of a shape.
- Use scale() with a for structure to scale a shape multiple times.
- Combine translate() and rotate() to rotate a shape around its own center.

### Motion 2: Machine, Organism
- Use Code Segment #16 as a base for creating a more advanced organism.

### Drawing 1: Static Forms
- Make a custom drawing tool that changes its form when a mouse button is pressed.

### Drawing 2: Kinetic Forms
- Design and program visual elements that change after they have been drawn
to the display window.
