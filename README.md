## Exercises

### Structure 1: Code Elements
- Write comments in the text area explaining a piece of software you would like to write
- Write a program to make a 640 x 480 pixel display window with a black background
- Use print() and println() to write some text to the console
  
### Data 1: Variables
- Make a few int and float variables. Try assigning them in different ways. Write the values to the console with println(). 
- Create a composition that scales proportionally with different window sizes. Put different values into size() to test.

### Shape 1: Coordinate, Primitives
- Create a 2D picture-perfect house using all the shapes you learned today.
